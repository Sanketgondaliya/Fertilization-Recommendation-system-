# Fertilization Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement

Farmers often rely on generalized recommendations or personal experience for fertilization, leading to:
- **Over-fertilization**: Excess nutrients harm the environment and contribute to soil degradation and water pollution.
- **Under-fertilization**: Limits crop potential and reduces yield, impacting farmer income and food security.
- **Inefficient resource management**: Unnecessary fertilizer use increases costs and environmental footprint.

To overcome these limitations, we use machine learning techniques to predict fertilization recommendations. Machine learning leverages historical data and statistical models to identify patterns and relationships, making accurate predictions.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering historical data on soil properties, crop types, weather conditions, and previous fertilization practices.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and normalizing features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to understand distributions, correlations, and patterns.
4. **Feature Engineering and Selection**: Creating new features and selecting the most relevant ones for the model.
5. **Model Selection**: Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms for the task.
6. **Model Training and Testing**: Splitting the data into training and testing sets, and training the models.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using various metrics.
8. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters to improve performance.
9. **Finalizing Model and Cross-Validation**: Selecting the best model and validating its performance on unseen data.
